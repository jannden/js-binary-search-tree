A binary search tree implemented as a class in JavaScript, which supports:

- Inserting data. It inserts a new node in the tree on the right spot based on the number value.
- Removing data. It removes the node with given data.
- Searching in-order. It performs a recursive in-order traversal of the tree starting from a given node.
- Searching pre-order. It performs a recursive pre-order traversal of the tree starting from a given node.
- Searching post-order. It performs a recursive post-order traversal of the tree starting from a given node.
